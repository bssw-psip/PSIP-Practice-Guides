## Using the Practice Guide

The Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) Practice
Guides are resources intended to help new users get started with PSIP.

These guides include information on when and why to practice PSIP, how to kick
off the process, how to set goals, and more.

If you are brand-new to PSIP, we recommend you begin with

what it can do for your scientific software development team. Learn more about
how to apply it by going through the following steps (as see below in the
