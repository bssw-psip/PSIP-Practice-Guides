# Practicing PSIP for the first time on your own: how to set goals

If you haven't already, take a look at our introduction to PSIP or [why practice PSIP](/practice-guides/pages/why_practice_PSIP.html) and [Step 1](/practice-guides/pages/how_to_start.html) to getting started on your own. The explanation below includes excerpts from the [BSSw PSIP Overview](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools/blob/master/PSIP-Overview.md):

Assuming you've completed [Step 1](/practice-guides/pages/how_to_start.html), you may have noticed that the process of describing current practices has several benefits. For some, the exercise leads to the first concrete description of these practices. A document developed with others usually leads to discussions among team members, improving understanding and creating insights about which practices can be improved and how. 

## Step 2: Set goals.

When setting productivity and sustainability improvement goals, look for improvements that can be realized in a few weeks or months, at least in early PSIP iterations. Larger goals are fine, if they can factored into smaller increments with delivered value. For example, if your team wants to have a goal of comprehensive testing, you will want to specify incremental goals in Step 5 toward the comprehensive goal.

As you set your goals, consider these questions, engaging external expertise as needed:
* What consumes most of our time? Where are we inefficient? Are there new ways to improve our efficiency?
* Where do we have quality problems? What are the sources of poor quality? How can we improve quality?
* Is our software product sustainable for its expected lifespan? What is limiting sustainability? How can we improve sustainability?
* Can I construct a goal with deliverable value in manageable increments?
* Can I complete the goal (or a subgoal) in one normal development iteration (a few weeks or months)?
* Will accomplishing the goal provide tangible payoff within a few months after completion?

After asking these, and similar questions, you will have a list of ideas for how to improve your practices. Next, you will create a [Progress Tracking Card (PTC)](/practice-guides/pages/how_to_create_ptc.html) that will help you establish baseline values and tangibly track progress as your practices improve.
