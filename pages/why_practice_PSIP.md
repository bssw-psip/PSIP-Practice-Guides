# What is PSIP?

Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) is a lightweight, iterative workflow that allows software development teams to identify development bottlenecks and track progress to overcome them. By practicing PSIP, teams are able to realize process improvements without a disruption to any current development processes. PSIP is a technique that can be used alongside tools you may currently use such as Kanban, Agile, etc.

# Why practice PSIP?

PSIP utilizes progress tracking cards (PTC). Progress tracking cards are concise visual aids that record your goals, deliverables, and milestones to internally compare your team's progress toward an intended goal. PSIP PTCs are not meant to be external assessments or evaluation tools. PSIP can help develop best practices and the use of PTCs will help keep track of your progress toward an objective. You can also use or share PTCs when communicating to other teams about your goals and how you know when you will have met your objectives.

# When should I practice PSIP?

Of course PSIP can be initiated at anytime, and we find PSIP is especially helpful when you or your team are 1) onboarding new team members unfamiliar with your current process, 2) your code has a new set of users/collaborators who need to understand your process for version control, and 3) the growth and success of your code base requires your team to interface with other teams more frequently. If any of these conditions describe your situation, we recommend you practice PSIP! Even if none of these conditions describe your situation, we still recommend you practice PSIP to upgrade team practices anytime!
