# Getting Started with PSIP

As you already know, PSIP framework is an iterative, incremental, repeatable,
cyclic process for improvement planning. The cyclic nature of PSIP enables you
and your team to improve overall project quality and achieve science goals by
encouraging frequent iteration and reflection.

PSIP consists of seven simple steps, as described below and on the next pages.
You and your team can work through these
steps on your own, or with the assistance of a PSIP facilitator. The process
described below assumes that you and/or your team will be practicing
PSIP on your own by following the guides.

The key to PSIP is understanding where you are starting from, setting goals,
and tracking your progress. The way you *implement PSIP* is by creating and
using progress tracking cards (PTC).

### Step 1: Summarize Current Project Practices

![Step 1 of PSIP](/practice-guides/assets/images/Step1Highlight.png)

The first step to PSIP is to have a good idea of your current state of practice and 
to document it. You'll want to have a record of the original state of your
project to create a baseline for measuring progress and to help identify areas
that are ready for improvement.

To do this, imagine that you are telling a stranger or your best friend about
your project using the bulleted lists below as a guide. How do you describe
your project? Write a short paragraph summarizing your project practices.

Use plain language and define your terms. That way, you'll be able to reduce
any misunderstandings that might arise from a vague term or one that may have
several meanings to different people. Your goal in this step is to be as
accurate as possible about your project.
The details below are excerpts from the [BSSw PSIP Overview](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools/blob/master/PSIP-Overview.md):

**Describe the overall software development process used by the project,
emphasizing what is most important for productivity and sustainability.**

- How software requirements are determined and transformed into implemented
  code, tested and deployed (the software lifecycle)
- How integration of new and revised capabilities into the existing software
  will preserve existing capabilities (regression testing)
- How users will learn about utilizing the code in their scientific efforts
  (documentation and training)

**Describe your tools and processes.**

- Source management tools and processes (how source code will be developed and
  managed)
- Issue tracking tools and processes (how feature requests and software faults
  or "bugs" will be recorded and managed)
- Testing tools and processes (how tests will be invoked and reported)
- Software distribution tools and processes (how will users and collaborators
  access software products)

**Describe training.**

- How new software developers will be trained
- How the value of the work of departing developers will be retained

**Describe improvement strategies.**

- How you presently improve software productivity and sustainability
- How improvement efforts will be rewarded

**Any software used but not developed (a.k.a, third-party software)?**

Use of third-party software typically reduces the cost (time and effort)
compared to developing the same capability independently.
At the same time, it also increases risk and complexity.
If your project makes significant use of scientific software developed by
others, the following topics should be addressed:

- Describe how the third-party software is tested for correct behavior,
  initially and when upgrading to a new version (verification and validation)
- Describe how loss of functionality via faults and missing features is
  handled by the third-party software
- Describe how complete loss of the third-party capability would be addressed
  by the application (risk mitigation)
