# Assessing Your Progress

<a href="https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_execute_plan.html"><img src="/practice-guides/assets/images/back_arrow.png" width="18" /> Go Back to Steps 5 & 6</a>

You are ready to assess your progress and repeat the process as needed.

## Step 7: Assess Progress

![Step 7 of PSIP](/practice-guides/assets/images/Step7Highlight.png)

During execution, teams assess and determine the rate of progress on a regularly defined basis
(weekly, monthly, etc.).
You can use PTCs to energize your team on the vision. Adjust your strategy
for success if needed. Refer frequently to your PTC and use it as a way to
gain consensus or refocus your efforts on your objectives.

When progress is delayed too long, start a new PSIP iteration. 

## Repeat

The PSIP process is iterative. Continual process improvement is a valuable
attribute for any software project. The PSIP process may be used to guide
improvement planning within software projects and across aggregate projects.
Use PSIP to your advantage: reframe your goals, refocus your team, and share
your PSIP with other teams to secure their buy-in.

The PSIP process is cyclical. Iterate as often as you need to.
Introduce new PTCs. Modify existing ones. Elevate your processes.
Upgrade your team practices.

We've talked about [Why Practice PSIP?](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/why_practice_PSIP.html).
Let's recap all of the steps:

1. [Summarize Current Project Practices](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_start.html)
2. [Set Goals](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_set_goals.html)
3. [Construct Progress Tracking Card (PTC)](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_create_ptc.html)
4. [Record Current PTC Values](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_create_ptc.html)
5. [Create Plan for Increasing PTC Values](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_execute_plan.html)
6. [Execute Plan](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_execute_plan.html)
7. [Assess Progress](https://bssw-psip.github.io/practice-guides/pages/how_to_assess_progress.html)

We encourage you to share your experience using PSIP and any artifacts
that were created as a part of your process (e.g., PTCs). See our
[Contributing Guide](https://bssw-psip.github.io/ptc-catalog/pages/how-to-contribute.html) for more information or chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/bssw-psip/community).
