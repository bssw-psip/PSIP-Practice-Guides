# Practicing PSIP for the first time on your own: how to create and execute a practice improvement plan

If you haven't already, take a look at [why practice PSIP](pages/why_practice_PSIP.md), [Step 1](pages/how_to_start.md), [Step 2](pages/how_to_set_goals.md), and [Steps 3 - 4](pages/how_to_create_ptc.md) to get started on your own. The explanation below includes excerpts from the [BSSw PSIP Overview](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools/blob/master/PSIP-Overview.md):

Assuming you've completed [Step 1](pages/how_to_start.md), [Step 2](pages/how_to_set_goals.md), and [Steps 3 - 4](pages/how_to_create_ptc.md) of PSIP, you are ready to create and execute your practice improvement plan.

Creating your plan requires a bit of thought about your current project tracking techniques. You may use Kanban, Agile, or another. We suggest you integrate your PTCs with your project process. We have provided 3 examples.

Let's be honest, if you really want to successfully execute your plan, you should revisit your PTC frequently--for your team it may mean during your weekly meetings or your retrospective. You may decide to execute your practice improvement plan a number of ways. 
 You should definitely use complementary SPI methods that you already use to execute your plan! We highly recommend that you explore our PTC example repo to see 3 ways we have anticipated you may want to integrate PTC with your existing project in Github. Take a look at our examples for inspiration. Feel free to customize our examples to fit your needs.
 
 Next you will [assess your plan](pages/how_to_assess_progress.md).
